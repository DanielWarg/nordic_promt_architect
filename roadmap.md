# Nordic Prompt Architect — Master Roadmap

This roadmap describes the journey from working MVP to "Enterprise Gold Standard".
Everything here is part of the long-term backlog and builds on the three core engines: Crystallize, Architect, and Verify.

## 📋 Status Legend

- [x] **Done** — Completed and tested
- [~] **In Progress** — Currently being implemented
- [ ] **Not Started** — Planned but not yet begun
- [!] **Blocked / Needs Research** — Requires decisions or external dependencies

---

## 🏁 Phase 1: Core Foundation — MVP Stabilization

**Sprint 1: Foundation**

*Goal: A robust, predictable, and crash-safe foundation.*

- [x] **Robust Config Loader**  
  - [x] Extension should read .superpromptrc.json automatically on startup  
  - [x] Hot Reload: config file updates should be read without restarting VS Code  
  - [x] Fallback to safe default values if config is missing or corrupt

- [x] **Transparent Logging — "The Trust Layer"**  
  - [x] New Output channel: "Nordic Prompt Logs"  
  - [x] Log everything: config loaded, sanitizer started, patterns found, template applied  
  - [x] Timestamps and performance metrics: "Sanitization completed in 12ms"

- [x] **Error Handling & Graceful Degradation**  
  - [x] Extension must never crash hard  
  - [x] Errors logged quietly in output channel (logger.error + VS Code warning)  
  - [x] User only sees warnings for critical obstacles

- [x] **First Run Experience / Onboarding**  
  - [x] Show installation notice instructing to run `SuperPrompt: Initialize Config`  
  - [x] Init command creates `.superpromptrc.json` with safe defaults and logs result  
  - [x] Safe defaults when config is missing + clear log message "No .superpromptrc.json found. Using secure defaults."

- [x] **Core Commands & UX Flow**  
  - [x] `superprompt.initConfig` creates config and logs info  
  - [x] `superprompt.crystallize` generates specs in split view  
  - [x] `superprompt.architect` sanitizes code and opens prompt output  
  - [x] `superprompt.verify` produces checklist  
  - [x] `superprompt.compareSelections` compares two selections and generates report

## 🛡️ Phase 2: Security Engine — Sanitizer v2

**Sprint 2: Security Engine v2**

*Goal: "The security chief should love this."*

- [x] **Extended Data Security Detection**  
  - [x] Swedish personal numbers (all formats)  
  - [x] Email addresses  
  - [x] Phone numbers  
  - [x] IP addresses (IPv4/IPv6)  
  - [x] API keys (OpenAI, AWS, Stripe, generic Bearer tokens)

- [x] **Token-based Masking**  
  - [x] <PNR_REDACTED>  
  - [x] <EMAIL_HIDDEN>  
  - [x] <API_KEY_SECURED>

- [x] **Dry-Run Mode (SuperPrompt: Analyze Safety Only)**  
  - [x] Run analysis without prompt  
  - [x] Writes report in log  
  - [x] Does not modify content

- [x] **Exclude Paths / Ignore Files**  
  - [x] New `security.exclude_paths` key in `.superpromptrc.json` (e.g., `**/tests/**`, `mocks/**`)  
  - [x] Sanitizer completely skips these paths without masking or warnings  
  - [x] Document default list and how it can be extended

  - [x] Risks  
  - [x] Acceptance Criteria

- [x] **The "Diplomat" Template**  
  - [x] Summary section
  - [x] Blockers section (always shows consistent professional message)
  - [x] Clarification requirements
  - [x] Next steps with "Needs Clarification" status
  - [x] Senior professional consultant tone

- [x] **Command: SuperPrompt – Crystallize Requirements**  
  - [x] Applied to selected text  
  - [x] Output in split view
  - [x] `superprompt.crystallizeSpec` - Generate Tech Spec
  - [x] `superprompt.crystallizeDiplomat` - Generate Diplomatic Reply
  - [x] `superprompt.crystallize` - Backward compatible alias

- [x] **Text Analysis Engine**
  - [x] PatternMatcher for extracting deadlines, blockers, risks, technical terms

## 🏗️ Phase 4: Architect Engine — Code & Prompt Design

**Sprint 5: Architect Engine**

*This phase unlocks the first business-critical premium feature. It transforms code sanitization from a security tool into a prompt engineering assistant.*

- [ ] **Context-Wrapping Framework**  
  - [ ] Persona-based templates (Senior TS architect, etc.)  
  - [ ] Strict best practice instructions

- [ ] **Language Awareness**  
  - [ ] TS / JS  
  - [ ] Python  
  - [ ] C#  
  - [ ] Java  
  - [ ] Language-specific instructions

- [ ] **Split View Guarantee**  
  - [ ] New tab  
  - [ ] ViewColumn.Beside  
  - [ ] Never overwrite original file

---

## 🔄 Phase 4.5: Work Item Integration — Azure DevOps & CRM 365

**Sprint 4.5: DevOps Integration**

*Goal: Make NPA not only produce specifications, but also push them into the delivery pipeline — without losing the "offline-first" principle for the standard version.*

- [ ] **DevOps-Optimized Tech Spec Template (Safe, Offline)**  
  - [ ] Add "DevOps Copy Block" to Tech Spec:
    - [ ] Title suggestion (single line summary)
    - [ ] Description block (markdown)
    - [ ] Acceptance Criteria formatted for DevOps
    - [ ] Suggested tags (e.g., `npa`, `crystallized`, domain-based tags)
  - [ ] Ensure output maps cleanly into Azure DevOps fields:
    - [ ] Title
    - [ ] Description
    - [ ] Acceptance Criteria (as markdown or checklist)
    - [ ] Tags
  - [ ] No network calls — fully offline

- [ ] **Azure DevOps Integration (Optional, Not Default)**  
  - [ ] New config section in `.superpromptrc.json`:
    ```json
    "azure": {
      "enabled": false,
      "organization": "",
      "project": "",
      "base_url": "",
      "pat": "use vscode secrets"
    }
    ```
  - [ ] Add new command: `superprompt.createDevOpsWorkItem`
  - [ ] Behavior:
    - [ ] Uses the Tech Spec output as payload
    - [ ] Creates a Work Item through Azure DevOps REST API
    - [ ] Shows confirmation toast with Work Item ID
    - [ ] Logs creation details in "Nordic Prompt Logs"
  - [ ] Must require:
    - [ ] `"force_offline": false`
    - [ ] `"azure.enabled": true`

- [ ] **CRM 365 / Dataverse Integration (Future Option)**  
  - [ ] Architecture placeholder for CRM connector
  - [ ] No implementation required yet
  - [ ] Requirements:
    - [ ] OAuth token support
    - [ ] Configurable mappings (case → DevOps → CRM)
  - [ ] Recommended as enterprise add-on, not community edition

**Constraints & Principles:**
- **Offline-first by default** — cloud features must be opt-in
- **Security-first** — PAT/token must be stored via VS Code Secret Store (not config file)
- **Deterministic output** — Tech Spec content must be clean, predictable, and safe for enterprise pipelines

**Expected Impact:**
- Developers can take vague Jira/Slack/email request → Crystallize → ready DevOps story in seconds
- Teams gain faster grooming, clearer specs, fewer missförstånd
- Enables future enterprise adoption where NPA becomes a bridge into Azure DevOps, Microsoft CRM 365, and custom work item pipelines

- [x] Is the UI 100% quiet on success?  
- [x] Are error messages calm and understandable?  
- [x] Is everything fast enough to feel "instant"?  
- [ ] Does it feel like a work tool, not a toy? (Final UX polish pending)

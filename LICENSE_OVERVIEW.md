# Nordic Prompt Architect – Licensing Overview

Nordic Prompt Architect uses a **dual-license model** to support both
open-source community usage and commercial SaaS/enterprise customers.

## 1. Community Edition – MIT License

Files covered:

– All source code in `src/`

– The VS Code extension distributed publicly

– Core features: Crystallize, Architect Basic, Verify Basic

– Documentation and examples

You can:

✔ Modify

✔ Fork

✔ Use privately or commercially

✔ Contribute freely

MIT restrictions still apply (copyright + liability clause).

## 2. Pro & Enterprise Edition – Commercial License

Covers all premium functionality, including but not limited to:

– Advanced sanitizer rules

– Enterprise policy engine

– Custom template loader

– Hosted APIs

– Multi-user config sync

– Workflow automation

– Team analytics

– Any SaaS-hosted features

You may NOT redistribute, host, or reverse-engineer these components.

## Why Dual Licensing?

This model enables:

– Open-source adoption (MIT)

– Commercial protection for premium features

– A clear path from free → Pro → Enterprise

– Long-term sustainability for the project

## Summary

Community Edition = MIT

Pro/Enterprise = Proprietary (Commercial License)
